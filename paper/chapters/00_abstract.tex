This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of language learning theory and its practical applications in the digital age, with a specific focus on gamified learning platforms. We examine traditional theoretical frameworks, particularly Krashen's hypotheses, and their relevance to modern language learning approaches. The paper addresses language acquisition across different proficiency levels (A1-C2) and presents practical implementations for multilingual learning platforms supporting Chinese, English, and German. Special attention is given to age-specific challenges and the integration of artificial intelligence in language learning.
