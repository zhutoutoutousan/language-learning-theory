\section{Conclusion}
The integration of theoretical understanding and practical implementation in language learning continues to evolve with technological advancement. Krashen's theories \citep{krashen2013second}, while foundational, find new applications in digital learning environments. The success of modern language learning platforms depends on their ability to balance theoretical principles with practical applications, while leveraging technology to create engaging, effective learning experiences.

The future of language learning lies in the intelligent combination of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Solid theoretical foundations
    \item Adaptive technology
    \item Personalized learning approaches
    \item Community engagement
    \item Cultural integration
\end{itemize}

As we move forward, the focus should remain on creating learning experiences that are not only effective but also engaging and accessible to learners of all backgrounds and abilities. The continued integration of AI, VR, and other emerging technologies, guided by sound pedagogical principles, will shape the future of language learning.
